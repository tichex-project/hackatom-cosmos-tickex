# TICHEX PROTOCOL
### THE FIRST EUR PEGGED ECOSYSTEM ON COSMOS

Tichex is a **DPoS blockchain based on Tendermint and Cosmos SDK**.
The blockchain is based on the Bizantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm (consent 2/3 of the network), with DPoS Stacking algorithm.

The first pegged zone in **EUR**, that is the **EUR/Crypto bridge of Cosmos** and at the same time it is the technological evolution of an already existing **European Financial Institution, namely Em@ney plc**.

On the Tichex blockchain it will be possible to create different types of tokens (similar to erc20).

The native coin will be **TCX**, it will be used to pay gas, for staking, fees, etc....
The other token will be **THEUR** (stable coin pagged to **EUR**)

The first 2 available modules are:

Module **ISSUE** with the following characteristics:

 - approve (Approve spend tokens on behalf of sender)
 - burn (Token holder burn the token)
 - burn-from (Token owner burn the token)
 - create (Issue a new token)
 - describe (Describe a token)
 - decrease-approval (Decrease approve spend tokens on behalf of sender)
 - freeze (Freeze the transfer from a address)
 - unfreeze (UnFreeze the transfer from an address)
 - increase-approval (Increase approve spend tokens on behalf of sender)
 - mint (Mint a token)
 - send-from (Send tokens from one address to another)
 - transfer-ownership (Transfer ownership of a token)
 - disable (Disable feature from a token)

Module **EXCHANGE**:
 - make (create a new order)
 - take (take an active order)
 - cancel (cancel an existing order)

Tichex was created to solve the problem of centralized stable coins. It also solves the problem of liquidity, be they **Crypto/crypto or Crypto/fiat**.
